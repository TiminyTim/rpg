# RPG - 41

##A tui dungeon, tileset style!

##A quick overview of some cool stuff:
- "Fog of war" world map that uses emojis instead of basic characters! 😏
- Collision detection - detects when you walk into a wall, item, door, enemy, etc 🚫
- Inventory sytem that shows coordinates, health, armor, and inventory items 🧀
- Loads Heroes and Monsters at start, and saves them upon exit 💾
- Based upon the legendary colors.h by ShakaUVM (#include "/public/colors.h") 👾

##TODO:
- Make tileset class for map
- Fix bad combat
- Fix fircular linked list 
- Do something about the 40 books. They're taking control of all available chars!
- Loot system for all Monsters
