# RPG - 41

##A tui dungeon, tileset style!

##Featured implementations:
- "Fog of war" world map that uses emojis instead of basic characters!
- Collision detection - detects when you walk into a wall, item, door, enemy, etc.
- Inventory sytem that uses potions, keys, and cheese.
- Uses the legendary colors.h by ShakaUVM (#include "/public/colors.h")
- Inventory system for all Heroes

##TODO:
- Make tileset class for map
- Fix bad combat
- Fix fircular linked list 
- Do something about the 40 books. They're taking control of all available chars!
- Loot system for all Monsters
